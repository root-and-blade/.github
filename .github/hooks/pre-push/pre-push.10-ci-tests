# This git hook will run the same commands that GitHub will run with the Pull Request locally prior to completing a
# push. This helps both developers and the organization by giving developers insight into whether the upcoming
# CI/CD pipeline will pass without having to wait for GitHub Actions to complete. It also helps the organization by
# reducing the number of failed actions that occur, reducing the number of GitHub action minutes (and therefore, costs)
# that are used for failures.
#
# This script requires that following are installed on your platform:
#
#   * Docker (https://www.docker.com/)
#   * Act (https://github.com/nektos/act)
#
# On macOS, you can install both with this command:
#
#   brew install act && brew install --cask docker
#
# For macOS platforms running on Apple Silicon (e.g., M1 CPUs), please make sure to refer to this repository's
# `README.md` file for further instructions on running tests locally.
#
# To install this hook, simply copy or symlink this file to any repository's `.git/hooks` directory; for example:
#
#   ln -s .github/hooks/pre-push.pull-requests-tests my_repository/.git/hooks/
#

echo "RUNNING PULL REQUESTS TESTS"
exit 1
